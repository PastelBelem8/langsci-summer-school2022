        "We divided the notebook into three main parts, as described below. The first one will be focused on the tokenization and how different models preprocess the text you feed as inputs. In the second part, we will be experimenting with two widely used **masked language model (MLM)** among the NLP community. These models were pretrained on large English corpora using a *fill-in the blank* task. Finally, we will apply the same *fill-in the blank* to a different model and assess its advantages and limitations over the BERT-based models.\n",
